Full Stack Application Development (S1-24_SEZG503)

TITLE: BOOK EXCHANGE PLATFORM
Problem Statement:
Book lovers frequently accumulate a collection of books they have read and look for other 
recommendations. They are always eager to explore new reading material. Traditional methods of 
exchanging books, such as local book swaps or lending among friends, are limited in scope and 
accessibility. Therefore, it is imperative to have a digital platform that can facilitate book exchanges on a 
larger scale. This platform should connect users with similar reading interests, enabling them to trade 
books easily and efficiently. This project aims to develop a full-stack web application that serves as a 
centralized platform for users to exchange, lend, and borrow books with other users. The platform 
should provide a user-friendly interface, robust search and recommendation features, and secure 
transaction capabilities.
Features:
User Authentication: Implement a secure user authentication system to allow users to register, log in, 
and manage their accounts.
Book Listing: Enable users to list books they want to exchange or lend, including details such as title, 
author, genre, condition, and availability status.

Book Search: Provide users with advanced search and filtering options to discover books based on 
criteria like genre, author, title, location, and availability.
Exchange Requests: Allow users to send and receive exchange requests for specific books, including 
negotiation options for terms such as delivery method and duration.
Messaging System: Implement a messaging system to facilitate user communication regarding book
exchanges, including negotiation details, logistics, and scheduling. (Mock API s can be used)
User Profiles: Enable users to create profiles with information about their reading preferences, favorite 
genres, and books they currently own or wish to acquire.
Transaction Management: Provide tools for users to track the status of their exchange transactions, 
including pending requests, accepted exchanges, and completed transactions.
Expected outcome
The book exchange platform should provide users with a convenient and efficient way to discover new 
reading material, share their favorite books with others, and connect with fellow book enthusiasts in 
their community. The platform aims to promote a reading culture and foster a sense of community 
among users by facilitating book exchanges.
